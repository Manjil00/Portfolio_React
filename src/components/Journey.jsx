    <p className='mt-10 text-slate-500 mx-10 text-sm md:text-xl tracking-wider'>I began my journey in web development with a strong focus on frontend technologies, particularly React.js. As I progressed, I honed my expertise in building dynamic and responsive web applications. I leveraged tools like Redux for efficient state management and Tailwind CSS for crafting streamlined, aesthetically pleasing user interfaces.<br/>
    <br/>

My passion for continuous learning eventually led me to explore full-stack development. I deepened my knowledge by working with technologies such as Next.js, which broadened my perspective on building scalable web solutions. I also delved into backend systems with tools like Prisma for database handling and Zod for data validation, allowing me to create robust, end-to-end solutions for web applications.

In addition to my development skills, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to develop (SaaS) products, e-commerce platform and developing and maintaining its features that address complex  needs. <br/>
